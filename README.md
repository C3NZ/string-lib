This project is a lightweight library that extends 
the functionality of javascripts built in `String` type with some functions that
may come in handy.

## Getting started
To get started, simply go into your project folder and run:
```
npm install @cenz/string-lib --save
```

This will install the string library into your application. To get access to the extended
functionallity that is provided by this library, add this to your `index.js` or whatever you're
using as your applications main point of entry:
```
require('@cenz/string-lib')
```
